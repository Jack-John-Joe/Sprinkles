# Sprinkles
Sprinkles is a revamp of my old project, Sublet.
### But what is Sprinkles/Sublet?
Sublet was a small lightweight package manager.
<br>But the thing was, it sucked. It also, wasn't lightweight.
#### So we fixed that.
### ok I get it, but what does it do
well,
#### Implemented or WIP
- Downloading and installing packages
- Compiling apps from source
#### Planned Features
- Repositories, right now we have a centralized database and nobody wants that.
- Better installation system (custom build lang and some lang to tell sprinkles what to do once it's downloaded something)
- Configuration (yeah ik it should exist already)
